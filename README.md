This is a list of useful tools, libraries and resources for working with [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) — online repository for scientific research papers.

## Search and Discovery

* **[Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)** — an open-access platform that bridges the gap between machine learning research papers and their corresponding code implementations. Attaches code repos, benchmarks and SOTA leaderboards.
* **[ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)** — an AI-powered research tool "Spotify for papers" designed to build collections, get algorithmic digests, and explore interactive citation/author graphs.
* **[Emergent Mind](https://www.emergentmind.com/)** — an AI-powered research assistant that helps researchers to explore and stay updated on cutting-edge computer science and AI research, primarily sourced from arXiv. It provides concise summaries, trending paper highlights, and interactive exploration tools like follow-up questions and topic links.
* **[Elicit](https://elicit.com)** — an AI research assistant that helps automate tasks like literature reviews, data extraction, and summarization using over 125 million academic papers. It enables users to ask research questions, extract data from PDFs (including tables), and generates summaries with source citations.
* **[searchthearxiv](https://github.com/augustwester/searchthearxiv)** — a semantic search engine designed to help users explore over 300,000 machine learning papers from arXiv using natural language queries or by inputting an arXiv link to find similar papers.
* **[ArxivXplorer](https://arxivxplorer.com/)** — a semantic search engine that enhances exploration of the arXiv. The platform also offers a ChatGPT plugin, enabling users to search, read, and reference arXiv papers directly within the chat interface.
* **[paperscape](https://github.com/paperscape)** — an open-source project that visualizes the arXiv preprint repository as an interactive map. Each paper is represented as a node, with its size indicating the number of citations and its position determined by citation relationships to other papers.
* **[connectedpapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)** — a visual tool designed to help researchers and applied scientists discover and explore academic papers relevant to their field of work.
* **[huggingface Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers)** — a community-curated platform that showcases trending and impactful machine learning research, updated daily by contributors like AK and the broader AI community. Each paper entry includes metadata, links to related models or datasets, and a discussion section where users can engage with authors and peers.
* **[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)** — a free, AI-powered research tool for navigating in scientific literature. It alows to search and analyze over 200 million scholarly papers across various disciplines, including computer science, neuroscience, and biomedicine.
* **[Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.com/)** — an online research tool designed to enhance the literature review process by visualizing the relationships between academic papers. It allows to monitor scholarly articles through interactive citation maps, known as "litmaps".
* **[Paper Digest](https://www.paperdigest.org/)** — an AI-powered academic research platform designed to assist researchers. It offers tools for generating literature reviews, summarizing research papers, and providing academic writing assistance, all while emphasizing accuracy and minimizing AI-generated inaccuracies.
* **[ML Papers of The Week](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Papers-of-the-Week)** — a GitHub repository curated that highlights top machine learning research papers on a weekly basis. Each entry includes links to selected papers, often accompanied by brief summaries or annotations.

## Datasets
* **[Arxiver Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/neuralwork/arxiver)** — more than 63k papers converted to multi-markdown format, published between January 2023 and October 2023. The dataset includes original metadata such as IDs, titles, abstracts, authors, publication dates. Available under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
* **[MINT-1T (arXiv)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/MINT-1T-ArXiv)** — a multimodel dataset comprising approximately 600,000 papers, designed to support large-scale multimodal pre-training tasks. This is a subset of the [MINT-1T collection](https://github.com/mlfoundations/MINT-1T), released under CC-BY-4.0 license.
* **[Cornell University arXiv Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv/data)** — over 1.7M scholarly articles across STEM fields. Includes title, authors, abstract, categories, and links to the full-text PDFs (the dataset doesn't contain parsed papers directly). CC0 1.0 license.
* **[arXiv Paper Abstracts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spsayakpaul/arxiv-paper-abstracts)** — dataset introduced for multi-label text classification. Contains paper titles, abstracts, and subject categories. Released under CC0 1.0 license.
* **[S2ORC](https://github.com/allenai/s2orc)** — a comprehensive dataset comprising over 81.1M academic papers, including arXiv. Provides rich metadata, paper abstracts, resolved bibliographic references, and full text for 8.1M open access papers. Available under ODC-By 1.0.
** **[unarXive](https://github.com/IllDepence/unarXive)** — a structured dataset of 1.9M arXiv LaTeX papers including full text, references, captions, mathematical notation preserved as LaTeX. It supports tasks like citation recommendation and IMRaD classification, with an open subset and full version available upon request. MIT license.
* **[SciEvo](https://github.com/Ahren09/SciEvo)** — a large-scale dataset designed to support scientometric research and the study of scientific knowledge evolution. Provides a collection of over 2M publications,  including detailed metadata and citation graphs. Available under the Apache 2.0 license.
