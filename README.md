# Awesome ArXiv

This is a list of useful tools, libraries and resources for working with [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) — online repository for scientific research papers.

## Search and Discovery

* **[Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)** — arXiv aggregator that attaches code repos, benchmarks and SOTA leaderboards, focusing on machine-learning.
* **[ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)** — "Spotify for papers", allowing to build collections, get algorithmic digests, and explore interactive citation/author graphs.
* **[Emergent Mind](https://www.emergentmind.com/)** — AI Research Assistant for finding the most relevant computer science papers on arXiv and synthesizing an answer with citations. Also provides trending papers lists.
* **[Elicit](https://elicit.com)** — an AI assistant for researchers and academics, allowing to search, summarize, extract data from, and chat with over 125 million papers.
* **[searchthearxiv](https://github.com/augustwester/searchthearxiv)** — a simple semantic search engine for more than 300,000 ML papers on arXiv, based on OpenAI embeddings.
* **[ArxivXplorer](https://arxivxplorer.com/)** — another semantic search engine over the arXiv papers.
* **[paperscape](https://github.com/paperscape)** — an interactive map of the arXiv papers.
* **[connectedpapers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)** — a tool for exploring related academic papers in a visual graph.
* **[huggingface Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers)** — a feed of curated papers updated daily, led by [AK](https://x.com/_akhaliq).
* **[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)** — a free, AI-powered research tool for navigating in scientific literature, covering different domains.

## Datasets

## Not working anymore

* * **[labml papers](https://papers.labml.ai/)** — lightweight arXiv feed focused on trending ML papers. Adds two-line summaries, social-media, similar-paper links.
* * **[arxiv-sanity-live](https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-lite)** — a user-friendly interface for exploring arXiv papers, offering features such as tagging and personal recommendations.
